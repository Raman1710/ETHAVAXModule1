# DivideByZero Smart Contract

The `DivideByZero` smart contract provides division operations with error handling for division by zero. It is implemented in Solidity, a programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Functions

The contract contains the following functions:

### `divide(uint256 numerator, uint256 denominator)`

This function performs division of two unsigned integers: `numerator` and `denominator`. It returns the result of the division.

- Parameters:
  - `numerator`: The dividend for the division.
  - `denominator`: The divisor for the division.

Before performing the division, this function checks if the `denominator` is not equal to zero using the `require` statement. If the `denominator` is zero, it raises an exception with the error message "Division by zero is not allowed."

### `divideWithAssert(uint256 numerator, uint256 denominator)`

Similar to the `divide` function, this function also performs division of two unsigned integers: `numerator` and `denominator`. It returns the result of the division.

- Parameters:
  - `numerator`: The dividend for the division.
  - `denominator`: The divisor for the division.

However, instead of using the `require` statement, this function uses the `assert` statement to check if the `denominator` is not equal to zero. If the `denominator` is zero, it triggers an assertion failure, causing the transaction to revert. This means that if the condition fails, the function terminates abruptly, and any changes made within the function are discarded.

### `divideWithRevert(uint256 numerator, uint256 denominator)`

This function also performs division of two unsigned integers: `numerator` and `denominator`. It returns the result of the division.

- Parameters:
  - `numerator`: The dividend for the division.
  - `denominator`: The divisor for the division.

Using an if statement, this function checks if the `denominator` is zero. If the `denominator` is zero, it calls the `revert` function with the error message "Division by zero is not allowed." Revert reverts all changes made to the state and discards the current transaction. If the `denominator` is non-zero, the division is performed, and the result is returned.
